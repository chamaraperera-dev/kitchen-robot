## About KitchenRobot

We are a technology startup focused on improving the lives of consumers through better nutrition. Most people are too busy with work, family and friends to cook and eat properly. This leads to a poor diet and unhealthy lifestyle choices, which can cause serious health problems such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity. Our goal is to improve these conditions through an AI-based solution. Using our platform, users can customize their own daily menu based on their preferences and dietary needs. Afterward, our proprietary AI algorithms will then create a personalized meal plan for them. However, we don't stop there! We also partner with local food delivery services so that our customers can receive freshly prepared meals delivered right to their doorsteps.
All this will be packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of the month.
